# tinyarray

If Python had arrays, I imagine they would be like this. 

Kind of like numpy arrays but a bit more lightweight (and not as much capability). No C backend.

Current limitation, only works on 1D arrays. Plan to add ND arrays.

## Installation
```shell
git clone https://github.com/harrisonlabollita/tinyarray.git
cd tinyarray
pip install .
```

## Running tests

```shell
python -m unittest
```
