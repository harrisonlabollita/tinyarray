# tinyarray

Lightweight arrays for Python. 

Kind of like numpy arrays but a bit more lightweight (and not as much capability). No C backend.

## Installation
```shell
git clone https://github.com/harrisonlabollita/tinyarray.git
cd tinyarray
pip install .
```

## Running tests

```shell
	python -m unittest
```
